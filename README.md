# Welcome to our aptamers Gibbs free energy prediction project!

## The "doc" folder
The doc folder contains all the .tex source files of different reports we had to routinely furnish. The "images" subfolder contains all the graphics included in said reports.

## The "src" folder
The src folder contains all the Jupyter and Python scripts we used in order to create our datasets and train our models. Most of our experiments were written in Jupyter and are self-descriptive. You only need to press the "run all cells" button and it should work. When the training of our models is finished, the scripts generate serialized files containing the weights of our models. These saved models were used in some other files in order to provide additionnal results for the analysis section of our report. Inside the  "results" subfolder, you will find some code we used in order to analyse and generate more results.
Inside the "data" subfolder, you will find our dataset in *Json* format and the code we wrote in order to generate it with the NUPACK library. To run this code or your own, you will need to install the NUPACK library on your machine https://www.nupack.org/download/overview.
